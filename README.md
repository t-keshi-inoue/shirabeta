## MyStruggle

This is a first Project Using Testing Library, Jest and Enzyme.
I didn't know what to test, how to test.
That was a little big deal for me to overcome.
In this project I try to find the best directory structure,
and got to the answer that is called "re-ducks".
This project is not perfect, there are many way left to improve user experience.
However, I did it widh all of my skills that I have today.
